# Bayesian Network Python Implementation

This Python script provides a Bayesian network implementation for probabilistic reasoning. The code defines classes and methods to construct and perform inference on a Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is composed of nodes representing random variables and their dependencies. The script takes input from three JSON files: `structure.json`, `values.json`, and `queries.json`.

## Structure

- **structure.json:** Defines the structure of the Bayesian network, including variables and their dependencies.
- **values.json:** Contains prior and conditional probabilities for the network's variables.
- **queries.json:** Specifies queries for Bayesian inference.

## Classes

### 1. Node

- Represents a node in the Bayesian network.
- Methods for initializing, setting probabilities, and retrieving probabilities.
- For prior nodes, the key is the variable's value. For conditional nodes, the key is a sorted tuple whose items are (variable, variable's value).

### 2. BayesianNetwork

- Manages the construction and inference of the Bayesian network based on the provided structure, values, and queries.
- Attributes include variables, dependencies, conditional probabilities, prior probabilities, queries, answer, and graph.
- Methods for constructing prior and conditional probability tables, initializing nodes, and performing Bayesian inference.

## Usage

```bash
python bayesianmodel.py structure.json values.json queries.json
