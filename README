# Synthetic City Data Generator with Bayesian Network Simulation

## Overview
This project provides a Python script to generate synthetic data representing a city with various types of objects, including houses, mountains, highways, tall buildings, schools, parks, and factories. The synthetic data can be used for simulating a Bayesian network to study the impact of a seismic event on the city.

## Object Types
- **House**: Residential building with details such as the number of rooms, presence of a garden, and garage.
- **Mountain**: Elevated land with no population.
- **Highway**: Transportation infrastructure with no population.
- **Tall Building**: High-rise building with details like the number of floors and presence of an elevator.
- **School**: Educational institution with details such as the number of classrooms and presence of a playground.
- **Park**: Recreational area with no population.
- **Factory**: Industrial building with details like production capacity and presence of a smokestack.

## Attributes
Each object in the city has the following attributes:
- **Type**: Type of the object (e.g., House, Mountain, Highway).
- **Material**: Material of the building (e.g., Concrete, Wood).
- **Population**: Number of people living in the building.
- **Age of Building**: Age of the building in years.
- **Maintenance Factor**: Maintenance factor of the building.
- **Ground Type**: Type of ground the object is located on.
- Additional attributes specific to certain object types.

## Bayesian Network Simulation
To simulate a Bayesian network study on the synthetic city data:
1. Define the Bayesian network structure based on the relationships between different attributes.
2. Use the generated city data as evidence for the Bayesian network simulation.
3. Analyze the network to understand the impact of a seismic event on different types of buildings and areas within the city.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script `city_generator.py` to generate synthetic city data:
    ```bash
    python city_generator.py
    ```
4. Use the generated data in a Bayesian network simulation script.

Feel free to customize the script, attributes, and Bayesian network simulation based on your specific simulation requirements.
